'use strict'

let even: number = 0;
while (even <= 500) {
	console.log(even);
	even++;
	even++;
}

// I have no idea if this shoud be done with while or for, but it works, so I guess it's okay like this
// also are 0 and 500 included or not?
// also I\'m pretty sure this is not how this should be done, but again, it works, so I'm not gonna change it
